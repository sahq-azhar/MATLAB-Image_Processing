<h1 align='center'> Image Processing Using MATLAB   </h1> <br>

This repository contains my image processing code. The codes are designed to recognise objects using HSV values from real-time video data.
The code is quite old. I accomplished this in 2017, and there have been many improvements and optimizations since then. The new approach will be updated in the 2021 folder.
